<p>These are people enlarged by experiences few could even fathom possible in this meager world, and they are much vilified in the popular press for their "exuberant imaginations" and for their denial of the notion of a "frontier." Such vilification is however unwarranted, as this world is in fact far stranger than any other, and as for the concept of a "frontier," it is just nothing but a hoax, a crude and easy means of allowing that everything is neatly contained within or without, is known or unknown.

<p>It's someone who tells me a secret, or a man who wants to call me by a name that isn't mine, or a person who admits that he hates my guts, even while he's poking them. I'm not a drunk and I don't have any kids at home. I'm just another member of the middle class, actually, another white-collar worker--or black panties worker, same thing--which is why I can work at this place discreetly. I fit in. And I enjoy what I do, but that's not to say that being in the sex industry is what turns me on. It's the connections. I like the stories. My boyfriend says that getting people to talk is a thing I do to make myself feel superior to other people but he's wrong. I do it for pleasure.</p>

Men have this world where what they do is wear jackets and gold and spend money and sell things, and they ache from loneliness and go crazy inside pretending that they're not me. I guess I want to find out what they're like. Sexually, the parameters are pretty well set. For many of my customers, it's merely about tension, about clenching every muscle inside your body tightly while you strain to orgasm and die, pretending, pretending that it isn't real. I can't change that, I'm not a sex therapist. All I can do is do the thing. Do the thing and talk. Like now, see--no, really--it's conversation that makes me come.</p>

An eye for quality and a nose for novelty have gotten you far, and they'll be no less useful here in Cyberia.

If at first you find yourself miffed at the exhaustive initiative required of you, recall that's what interested you in this trip in the first place.  It’s the reason why you'll <a data-passage="Brochure/Trip.html">discover so much more</a> here in Cyberia.</p><p>There will be shopping for regional specialties, tours to poke around the old neighborhoods, run-ins with local lunatics.  You will want to develop a sense of the comedy and tragedy, a feel for what it means to be a person here, a spirit, a victim, a tyrant in Cyberia.  That's why you'll turn to <a data-passage="Brochure/Cyberlit.html">literature</a>.  You will have come all this way, and you will need a place to stay.  </p><p>Where you visit is a declaration of intention, a gambit of potential.  Where you decide to stay is simply an extension of the self.</p><p>You have visited other cities which prepare you for this one:  La Cable, with its adjacent neighborhoods of all-night entertainments; Arcadia, with its dim canals winding through canyons of coin-operated diversions.

<p>The final question might be, so why bother? I'm sure we'll all become great writers and move on to bigger and better things in more accessible mediums. Well, one of the reasons is that hypertext allows you to do a lot of things that you can't do otherwise and I mean this in terms of fiction. "Fiction" especially the novelistic/ short story mode we're so used to these days, comes with a lot of baggage and it assumes certain things that, as you learn to perfect your craft in that medium, necessarily constrain. I personally don't think it's as free as everyone makes it out to be, even in its more experimental modes. <b><i>You could do something revolutionary</i></b>, if you really worked at it, <b><i>but you could do it more easily in hypertext.</i></b> Not that you'd want to, but the awareness of doing it first in hypertext might allow you to realize a method for carrying it out in book form, or another form. So, depending on your agenda, be it ideological, political, poetical, personal, or biological, it seems to me hypertext can greatly enable you toward realizing some things you might not have been able to otherwise, and that's why it's important.</p><p>{{{---}}}alu</p>

He pulled out a half-smoked panetella and put the wrong end in his mouth, slapped his pockets for a match. I handed him a box from behind the bar. He got one match out before dropping the box, then he threw the match away, too. He wallowed the cigar about in his mouth and said, "And I'm drinking tequila, sonnyboy. No fancy shit.

<p>The iron boy in a ring of stone wakes to find himself in a butterfly garden. A million wings. The butterflies are the size of hawks, with antennae that will tear his skin. Everywhere he ventures he finds more bites. Swelling cocoons hang from the trees of this garden. He wanders with the hope of finding a fairy tucked behind a rock or small bush, but there is nowhere he or any other creature can hide. The garden of torn skin, the garden of early death and intense happiness. Each time they cut into his flesh he feels a pleasant tingle in his chest and throat. The iron prince wears a crown of stone. Perhaps he will leap back into his own world with wings.</p>

<h3>(1) To aid the construction workers, who are known, when frustrated, to throw bricks, Board members are urged to retain intact the "overview" structures of the Front Desk, the Room Directory, the Service Directory, and the Employees Only area. New constructions may be placed within any of these premises, as appropriate, or may be left outside on the Hotel grounds (overview map) for later distribution.</h3><h3>(2) All new additions to the Hotel should be titled in some manner, with the Board member's initials PRECEDING the title. Later, these initials will be removed. For the present, this makes a Menu search easier in locating new constructions for Board discussion and architectural integration, and gives credit where credit is due. Thus, if a member of the Administrative Staff were to add this window to the Hotel, it would be titled "RA - House Rules" or "RC - House Rules."</h3><h3>(3) To be sure of access and to prevent dead ends, each new addition should, minimally, have a door in and a door out, even if it is the same door. This is most easily accomplished with default (window-to-window) links, one into the new addition from some existing window, one out of the addition to some existing window (it can be a return link to the same window from which it came). If the existing window from which the new addition is to link already has a default link to some other space, then a word-to-window link would be more appropriate. </h3><h3>(4) The use of the dollar sign "$" as a prefix for window titles will be limited to summary descriptions housed in "Ongoing Stories" and "Storycells" in the "Construction" folder. This allows for a more efficient use of the Menus when searching the Hotel for specific windows. If material from these areas is integrated into the Hotel, the $ sign can be removed. </h3>

You, too, afraid of heights! How long and wearied have my searches for a kindred spirit been! I breathe your air, I speak your language, we share a commonality of soul. Ah, Matt.</h3><h3>I must make a brief note here, regarding Nilla wafers and pudding. I myself have never had any particular problem with these things and I must say, that hearing you admit your fear of such does make me a bit doubtful of your validity as a man of the world and all, and I am afraid to say, makes you therefore an unlikely soul-mate, but in any case, march on.</h3><h3>mk.</h3><p>4/18</p><p>What is god's name is going on here, Housefone?I go away for a few weeks and what happens?You let yourself turn into some kind of dating service or something.Well, I'll let you off lightly this time, but no more of this self-help Nilla wafer nonsense, all right?This is <i>supposed</i>to be <i>literature</i>, or have you forgotten?This is supposed to be serious, high-minded stuff going on here; no low innuendo or pop culture reference or unnecessary lewdness or postmodern pastiche will be tolerated within the confines of the housefone, do you understand me? Son, I regard you as a work of literature, and that makes you special.The realm of literature is sacred, and it can't be marred by silliness.If we let literature go, who knows what'll be next.Literature is all we have left of the ideal, and if we let the ideal be tarnished by shoddy things like nilla-wafer- and sleeping-with-cucumber-jokes then what will remain untarnished?</p><p>I know, son, your response is going to be "Dad, but you can't just shut those things out.They really exist out there and they have every right to be reflected in any truly objective representation of the world such as myself."But I say you're wrong, son.Don't waste my time talking to me about reality.I have more important things to think about.The world is falling apart; I read about it every day in the newspapers, and I can't do anything about it.I seem to have lost the power to shape the real world in any way, so I have to be content with shaping an ideal one, and that's you, boy, whether you like it or not.I have to make sure you're in tiptop shape, because one day humanity will get tired of reality, and they'll realize that they've pretty much irrevocably screwed up the real world, and they'll have to retreat into the ideal one us earlier visionaries of their race have created in literature.</p><p>And that means there will be people looking to you for answers.Yes, even you, even the housefone.And the answers shouldn't have to be nilla wafers and LSD and ear-melting jokes (yes, even I make mistakes).I'm not trying to censor your right to self-expression, son, I'm just trying to exhort you to choose the right path.

<p>A couple floats through the hotel to the courtyard, inside the garden. They cling to the idea that talking while sitting on stone benches under stars somehow means that their conversation will be meaningful, instead of mere everyday chatter. They have come to the hotel to forget the state of existing with each other. Here in the hotel they can always leave to go fuck in their room and forget why they needed to talk. Here in the hotel with the peaceful old garden, they will lean over their table at dinner and kiss in front of all the other guests, and will say "I love you" too many times. They will hold hands, and twinkle eyes at each other. The ability to forget the past and future someone else's exists in the <a data-passage="SEM_-_Service_Directory/A_Garden.html">garden</a> in the hotel. </p><p>"What are you afraid of?" the man asks his companion.</p>/*

<p>Rising in the grand ballroom of the hotel to address the annual convention of novelty salespersons, most of whom, she noted were wearing carnivalesque masks and latex body suits (the theme this year was "Creative Condoms"), she realized that the theme of her speech, "Novelty's Last Frontier: Wisdom," was far too avantgarde for this giddy crowd of old-fashioned carny barkers, so instead (and, besides, the seat of her own elastic costume had remained stuck to her chair when she rose--some fellow delegate's prank?--and she could not long keep her footing before being snapped back into her seat) she raised the traditional toast "to man's most ancient experience: the new!" and fell backwards, hoping only that someone had had the kindness of putting a whoopee cushion under her so she wouldn't have to invent her punchline by her own steam, as it were.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 1.5em;">The Smiling Potato-Headed Snarklefish: the well-cooked half-ton beast is this year's prized catch. Not only have its scales been bronzed to match the Ballroom's decor, but its tender flesh can suit any taste: taken from the head, one can discern a rustic port-wine embellishing a fine <i>mignon</i>; taken from the tail, in its texture and aroma one senses <i>penne a la Vodka</i>. And, thankfully, any piece carved from its flanks tastes like chicken in a variety of preparations. The proud hunter steps forth as the delicacy is about to be unveiled:</p>

Frequently during the Balderdashers' conventions, she eschews even clothing on her evening outings to the Grand Ballroom, preferring instead to paint herself with the pungent juice of Huikok berries collected personally from the Huikok bush, native only to the infested swamps of Borneo. A small group - principally Hotel guests not associated with IAS and drawn by the sweet-sour aroma of the fermented Huikok berries commingled with Louise's own exudations - collects each night in a corner of the ballroom as, seated on a velvet gold settee, she recounts her adventures, including her world-famous discovery of the Universal Sex Fish along the steamy banks of the Upper Niger River. Her tone, as always, is scholarly and grave, her dark eyes glitter, her purple thumb is thrust deep into her navel, where faint sucking sounds can be heard. <a data-passage="Grand_Reunion/Main_Dish.html">"Quite unlike the Smiling Potato-Headed Snarklefish, on which we have been feasting tonight,"</a> she says, "the Universal Sex Fish has no teeth.

A terribly small man was trying to share a story with a small group of friends but succeeded only in annoying them.

<p>On the bar was a National Geographic inside of which I found photos of a woman, three photos of the same woman, and in all three photos the first thing that I noticed was the hugeness of her nipples. You could have wrapped your fist around those things and not met finger to thumb. I had a little knife in my pocket, so I cut the pictures out of the magazine and took them up to my hotel room, where I taped them up over the landscape prints above the heads of the beds. I figured that if I was going  to be staying in this hotel for a few days, I wanted to have some fascinating stuff to look at on the walls.</p><p>I turned on the television and took my shoes off. There was a very funny program on the tv, but I couldn't get my mind off of those nipples. They frightened me, they were so unlike anything I had ever seen. I turned around and focused the reading lights on the pictures.  I sat Indian style on the mattress and looked up at those pictures. I began to realize that they were actually pictures of three different people! I just couldn't see beyond those nipples!!</p>

That was thirty years ago, and today they still live a happy life exploring the wonders of the universe together, making frequent and novel use of their interchangeable sex organs.

<p style="text-indent: 1.5em;">Joseph was a promising PhD candidate in animal linguistics, otherwise known as zoophilology, before politico-medical complications cut short his education. His left arm, it seems, had resolutely determined that writing was not an activity it was willing to pursue. Although Joseph was right-handed, his rebellious left arm bred socialist contempt throughout his body for the bourgeois scum that would immiserate his comrade to the right with the servile task of key-punching. Consequently Joseph discovered that setting foot near computer terminals inevitably resulted in bruising, crunched testes, or loosened teeth - acts instigated by his unruly left arm. Thus, the bookish world denied him, illiterate Joseph was dismissed to a more physically structured life. His left arm has cooperated ever since, and has even occasionally given him pleasure.</p>

Sarah's mother was zipping down the winding road through the woods to the Y, late as always, Sarah sitting patiently in the passenger seat, clutching her skates in her lap and polishing the blades, eager to get to the rink to show off some new spins she'd been learning. Suddenly, a tree, caught in the violent storm, was toppling in the road in front of them. Her mother slammed her foot on the brake, and the car commenced to spin gracefully like an Olympic skater. The world whirled around them and then suddenly stopped. Sarah was pitched forward against her skates. She was in and out of hospital for a year after that and, although the doctors insisted that with practice she would have no problem skating as well as she ever did, Sarah never returned to the ice. She dreaded the skates, their leather tops bloodstained still, dreaded even more the dizzyingThe spins.</p>

He experimented on his lunch break, inserting different amounts of taco innards into the tortillas, trying to discover the maximum amount that could be put in without it squirting out the back end with the first bite. It turned out that the maximum amount was zero, but he kept trying. And they kept yelling at him. His bosses, the customers, even his highschool friends.

Most of the time anyway. Sometimes she just let herself go. What did it matter? She accepted the tawdry emptiness of the hotel life as befitting one whose dreams had been so cheaply ruined. She disdained the management, mocked the guests. She laughed at fate.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 1.5em;">"Seemingly amicable, this graceful creature is capable of the most insidious behavior when threatened. The primary defense of the Smiling Snarklefish, I have been able to deduce, is to befriend and then eat its enemy. It is aware of its outwardly appealing nature and capitalizes on it by appearing to welcome all who chance upon it with a formidable smile, one stretching - more than twenty feet - from gill to gill. The naive sightseer approaches, helplessly disarmed by this unexpected expression of affectionate joy. Then, in one sudden, violent motion the gregarious smile opens to reveal teeth of stupendous proportion which clamp down upon the woeful tourist. My handsman was, alas, thus consumed, though he was a tough little fellow and it took the fish a good bit of chewing before he could choke him down." Light but generous laughter. A small notation is made beside twenty-two others on a memorial chalkboard on the back wall of the Ballroom. "Which gave me just enough time to ready myself..."</p>

He cannot reach the elevator buttons. "Which floor?" asks Freddy. "Sixth," says the child in a voice that is not a child's.

<p style="text-indent: 1.5em;">"Wait!" says Purple Louise, rising to her feet again and, after sniffing her fingers, accepting a canape of pickled manatee cheeks in puff pastry being passed around by the Hotel staff. The lady Balderdasher's account of her discovery of the Universal Sex Fish is evidently not yet concluded. "Out of nowhere a fellow explorer - perhaps, as it were, a student of mine - came crashing through the bushes behind me. Startled, I scrambled away, slapping through the mud on all fours, but it was not me he was after. He dove into the steamy water in pursuit of the fish. He returned, smiling, to the surface, the beast in hand, and, standing still in the river, facing me, proceeded to stroke the creature's cleft proboscis, if that was what it was. The thing began to swell, a mouth opened, and, as though of its own volition, the fish impaled itself on the intrepid adventurer's stiffened member and commenced to pulsate furiously once again. In a matter of seconds the affair was settled and the man fell back into the river, spent, though the fish's piston-like motions continued and perhaps -<a data-passage="Balderdashers/A_Central_Tenet.html"> Nature, my friends, is not benign! </a>- continue to this very day!

<p>"I am a collector of exotic fish," remarks a member of Louise's audience, and others take up a similar refrain. "I should like to own one of the strange little creatures for further study." "No doubt," replies <a data-passage="Grand_Reunion/Purple_Louise.html">Purple Louise,</a> returning her thumb to her navel and her lean unflinching buns to the velvet cushions of the gold settee. "Aware of the public interest the Universal Sex Fish must inevitably arouse, I sought to grow them in special fish farms, there on the upper Niger in their own natural habitat. But, alas, they shriveled and died in captivity, and their breeding habits remain to this day an insoluble mystery."</p>/*

<p style="text-indent: 1.5em;">"The Universal Sex Fish is a pale oblong entity with a diameter of two or three inches at its base, five or six at its head, and is normally no greater than one foot in length, though these dimensions can vary considerably from fish to fish. Its elastic musculature allows it to wriggle along the muddy banks of the river much like the Giant Slime-Eating Maggot, which we have had the pleasure of banqueting on at previous IAS conventions. I had heard local lore describe the fish's unusual talents, but only an empirical demonstration would satisfy my scientific curiosity. I therefore decided to spend an afternoon basking in the creature's hot sodden habitat dressed as you see me now, as I had been informed that the one-eyed fish, nearly blind, would not approach what it could not clearly see. Or smell." Louise, in her best pedagogical manner, spreads her purple legs on the gold settee and, <a data-passage="The_Universal_Sex_Fish/withdrawing_her_thumb.html">withdrawing her thumb from her navel,</a> points to what her two-eyed auditors can quite clearly see.</p>/*

Here was the thing—here is the thing, he tells himself, surfacing into the present.  I’m ready to have a good time, I think, surfacing into my own person.  Ludicrous!

He sucked quietly on the reed that he'd attached to the mouthpiece just for show, so that if any nosy hotel staff came in he could show them that he was a musician, and proud of it, man. <a data-passage="Room_412/Saxophone.html">After all, he loved his horn; it had become an inseparable part of him.</a></p>/*

<p>He wrested the sax away and, still smiling, strode forward quietly, calmly, opened his glass door, stepped out onto the balcony, and threw the saxophone in a triumphant soaring arc over the edge. After a moment of shiny glory during which the instrument seemed almost to wail, it hit the pool with a muffled splash, and a scream drifted up from somewhere below.</p>

<p>It was shiny and brass, and that's why he liked it.  He remembered with reverence the beautiful sounds that it could make, especially in the hands of people like Bird, Hawk, Pres or even Paul Desmond.  Sounds that could change your life, y'know: music, and richness, and rippling solos that made you think of the first time you'd felt a girl up.  Strains of "Take Five" drifted through his head as <a data-passage="Room_412/Coke.html">he took another snort from the bell of the saxophone.</a>  That trip to South America had been lucrative, all right.  Two kilos of the best available coke, about ten million street dollars' worth.

<p>He looked at the sax again and thought that it was definitely time for some music. The bell still had some coke in it. He knew that if he blew, he'd lose blow, but he didn't care.  He still had plenty left, and he knew that soon the money would start rolling in.  Just the same, though, another hit wouldn't hurt; he took it, and almost drained the bell.

<p>He'd been suspicious for a while about her.  She'd been so enthusiastic it'd almost made him lose lunch.  She'd been the one that'd actually gotten the stuff from the cartel.  She'd dealt with the guys personally; hers was the face that they would mark for extinction if she ever thought about squealing to the Feds.  That fact in itself had put him on alert; anyone that really <i>wanted</i>  to deal with those people had to be a little fishy.  And so after she'd come back with the stuff and demanded fifty percent of the take, up from her original agreement to ten percent, he'd ruffled through her goods, and he'd found it. The badge that gave her away, in her diaphragm case.  She was pretty swift, that one, smart enough to bowl him over, but she'd missed out on some of the finer points of the drug trade.  She should never have hidden something as dangerous as that badge in a goddamn diaphragm case. Stuff like that goes in your vagina, or anus, or both.

<p>There is a sock on the floor. There is a great feeling of order and imprisonment, discipline and punishment, death, destruction, flowers, beauty. You knew there was something you wanted to say to the boy, and now it is over, there is no choice, no chance, and flowers of evil are popping out of your grave like sea grapes waiting to be popped and devoured by hungry children or vultures. There is a real sense of accomplishment in everything you do now. The sad thing is, this isn't even a write-up, it's a practice run, a dream, this isn't even real life, a real hotel, that's the really sad thing.</p>

<p>Now a whole is that which has a beginning, middle, <a data-passage="Farewell/The_End_or_Not_the_End.html">and end.</a> A beginning is that which is not itself necessarily after anything else, and which has naturally something else after it; an end is that which is naturally after something else, either as its necessary or usual consequent, and with nothing else after it; and a middle, that which is by nature after one thing, and also has another after it... A well constructed Plot, therefore, cannot either begin or end at any point one likes; beginning and end in it must be of the forms just described.

<p>Golf is a sport of contained fury, of controlled power. Whereas athletes in other sports can purge their frustrations and express their characters by slamming a dunk, sacking a quarterback, or kicking a soccer ball, golfers have no outlet for the emotions that are an undeniable component of competitive play. Golf demands precision and control rather than bursts of effort and feeling.<a data-passage="The_Hotel_Golf_Course/Golf_Fans.html"> So it's understandable that golfers exhibit less personality: </a>That is part of the internal nature of the sport.</p>/*

"Hey, dickhead, the lady wants some ice, give her some ice!" he bellowed. He staggered away a step, staggered back, planted a kiss on her somewhere in the neighborhood of her ear. He had forgot to take the cigar out of his mouth, though, so that got mashed into her hair. He spat out the remains, and slammed his fist down on the bar as though making some point or other, then tried to shift his bulk up on a barstool.</p>

<i><p>Says I to Bart, "You'll live all your death in that chest if ye blasts this chest  of mine full of lead!" "A waste of last words: a pitiful plea; a lie.  The next moment my spirit was blasted over them boards that boxed the bright doubloons, my mind's eye molding where once were pearls.</p><p>The passage of two centuries? Three? And one overcast Sunday—unbearably bright!—the church bells pealing—inconceivably shrill!—my empty casket is unearthed at Santo Domingo.  A short rocking journey deep in a hold, the consoling motion of which seems at last a vindication of all my years sunk in earth.  At a bench in a bus station, a brief conversation in broken Spanish with an unidentified thief.  Trucking through rural Florida, a passing voice in the dialect of the undead, muttering nonsense:  Ladelhaus.  Then, nonstop for the past ten years, the banal babble of the miserably-living:  'Nother Margarita!"  "Brighten up, honey!  It's happy hour!"  "Can I dry you a blink?"</p><p>"My only consolation comes when I can muster enough concentration to tip a passing tray of nachos, move a man to rude noises across from his date, send the hurricane lamps flickering. The bartender, the waitresses—they have a name for me.  Perhaps it's <a data-passage="Lounge_Ghost/McTeague_Biography.html">the only name they know </a>from the once-great pilfering vocation:  Bart. On slow nights they call, half-mockingly, for a little show.  I act up only when they shut up.</p></i>/*
